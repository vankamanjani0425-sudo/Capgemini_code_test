Develop an UI which accepts the below data and return a monthly premium amount to be calculated.

The UI provides a below list of occupations

There is a factor associated with each rating as below,    
Occupation Rating
Rating	Factor
Professional	1.5

Light Manual	11.50
Heavy Manual	31.75
 
1.	For any given individual the monthly premium is calculated using the below formula
Death Premium = (Death Cover amount * Occupation Rating Factor * Age) /1000 * 12
1.	All input fields are mandatory.
2.	Given all the input fields are specified, change in the occupation dropdown should trigger the premium calculation
